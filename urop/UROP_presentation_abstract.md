Much attention has been devoted to path planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, especially those with difficult dynamic constraints, such as fixed-wing aircraft. Computing safe and optimal paths for UAVs with dynamic constraints can be computationally complex and can require long planning times, especially in high-dimensional configuration spaces. In this work, we look at a subset of 3-D configuration spaces which are common to outdoor UAV path planning. We then reduce the dimension of such configuration spaces by solving a convex optimization problem which takes into account the terrain in the configuration space and vehicle's altitude constraints. Plans in the reduced-dimensionality space are feasible and optimal, but can be computed more quickly. We then verify these results with an RRT-based planner for a UAV with such constraints.
