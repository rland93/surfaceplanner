  abstract = {Path planning is one of the most important problems to be explored in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for finding an optimal path between source and destination. Although, in literature, a lot of research proposals exist on the path planning problems of UAVs but still issues of target location and identification persist keeping in view of the high mobility of UAVs. To solve these issues in UAVs path planning, optimal decisions need to be taken for various mission-critical operations performed by UAVs. These decisions require a map or graph of the mission environment so that UAVs are aware of their locations with respect to the map or graph. Keeping focus on the aforementioned points, this paper analyzes various UAVs path planning techniques used over the past many years. The aim of path planning techniques is not only to find an optimal and shortest path but also to provide the collision-free environment to the UAVs. It is important to have path planning techniques to compute a safe path in the shortest possible time to the final destination. In this paper, various path planning techniques for UAVs are classified into three broad categories, i.e., representative techniques, cooperative techniques, and non-cooperative techniques. With these techniques, coverage and connectivity of the UAVs network communication are discussed and analyzed. Based on each category of UAVs path planning, a critical analysis of the existing proposals has also been done. For better understanding, various comparison tables using parameters such as-path length, optimality, completeness, cost-efficiency, time efficiency, energy-efficiency, robustness and collision avoidance are also included in the text. In addition, a number of open research problems based on UAVs path planning and UAVs network communication are explored to provide deep insights to the readers.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of 3D path generation and tracking for unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). The proposed path generation algorithm allows us to find a path satisfying arbitrary initial and final conditions, specified in terms of position and velocity. Our method assumes that most of aircraft structural and dynamic limitations can be translated in a turn radius constraint; therefore, the generated paths satisfy a constraint on the minimum admissible turning radius. The proposed algorithm for the path tracking guarantees, under specified assumptions, that the tracking error, both in position and in attitude, asymptotically tends to zero. The work has been carried out with reference to the UAV of the Italian Aerospace Research Center (CIRA). Simulation results for both the path generation and the tracking algorithms are presented; the latter have been obtained using a detailed 6-degree-of-freedom model of the CIRA UAV in the presence of wind and turbulence},

  abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to present a comprehensive review in major research areas of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) navigation, i.e. three degree-of-freedom (3D) path planning, routing algorithm and routing protocols. The paper is further aimed to provide a meaningful comparison among these algorithms and methods and also intend to find the best ones for a particular application. Design/methodology/approach The major UAV navigation research areas are further classified into different categories based on methods and models. Each category is discussed in detail with updated research work done in that very domain. Performance evaluation criteria are defined separately for each category. Based on these criteria and research challenges, research questions are also proposed in this work and answered in discussion according to the presented literature review. Findings The research has found that conventional and node-based algorithms are a popular choice for path planning. Similarly, the graph-based methods are preferred for route planning and hybrid routing protocols are proved better in providing performance. The research has also found promising areas for future research directions, i.e. critical link method for UAV path planning and queuing theory as a routing algorithm for large UAV networks. Originality/value The proposed work is a first attempt to provide a comprehensive study on all research aspects of UAV navigation. In addition, a comparison of these methods, algorithms and techniques based on standard performance criteria is also presented the very first time.},

This task is integral to many robotic applications, such as vacuum cleaning robots, painter robots, autonomous underwater vehicles creating image mosaics, demining robots, lawn mowers, automated harvesters, window cleaners and inspection of complex structures, just to name a few. A considerable body of research has addressed the CPP problem. However, no updated surveys on CPP reflecting recent advances in the field have been presented in the past ten years. In this paper, we present a review of the most successful CPP methods, focusing on the achievements made in the past decade. Furthermore, we discuss reported field applications of the described CPP methods. This work aims to become a starting point for researchers who are initiating their endeavors in CPP. Likewise, this work aims to present a comprehensive review of the recent breakthroughs in the field, providing links to the most interesting and successful works.},

A recently proposed extension of RRT, known as Rapidly Exploring Random Tree Star (RRT*), claims to achieve convergence towards the optimal solution but has been proven to take an infinite time to do so and with a slow convergence rate. To overcome these limitations, we propose an extension of RRT*, called RRT*-Smart, which aims to accelerate its rate of convergence and to reach an optimum or near optimum solution at a much faster rate and at a reduced execution time. Our novel algorithm inculcates two new techniques in RRT*: these are path optimization and intelligent sampling. Simulation results presented in various obstacle cluttered environments confirm the efficiency of RRT*-Smart.},

In detail, the authors develop and demonstrate a method based on the closed-loop rapidly-exploring random tree algorithm and three variations of it. The variations are: 1) simplification of trajectory generation strategy; 2) utilization of intermediate waypoints; 3) collision prediction using reachable set. The methods were validated in software-in-the-loop simulations, hardware-in-the-loop simulations, and real flight experiments. It is shown that the algorithms are able to generate collision free paths in real time for the different types of UAVs among moving obstacles of different numbers, approaching angles, and speeds.},

The nature of the obstacles can be, for example, radar detection areas, cooperating and non-cooperating vehicles, and so on. Thus, it is a complex trajectory planning problem. The proposed planner is based on the optimal rapidly exploring random tree (RRT*) algorithm. Artificial potential fields are combined with the RRT* algorithm to accelerate the convergence speed to a suboptimal solution by biasing the random state generation. The performance of this framework is demonstrated on a complex missile application in a heterogeneous environment. Indeed, since the air density decreases exponentially with altitude, the maneuverability of the aerial vehicle depending on aerodynamic forces also decreases exponentially with altitude. To face this problem, the shortest paths of Dubins-like vehicles traveling in a heterogeneous environment are used to build the metric. In the simulation results, this framework can find the first solution with fewer iterations than the RRT and the RRT* algorithm. Moreover, the final solution obtained within a given number of iterations is closer to an optimal solution regarding the considered criterion.},

We propose a novel method to solve the problem to get a feasible and safe path. Firstly STs are modeled based on intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) to express the uncertainties in STs. The methods for ST assessment and synthesizing are presented. A reachability set (RS) estimator of DT is developed based on rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) to predict the threat of DT. Secondly a subgoal selector is proposed and integrated into the planning system to decrease the cost of planning, accelerate the path searching and reduce threats on a path. Receding horizon (RH) is introduced to solve the online path planning problem in a dynamic and partially unknown environment. A local path planner is constructed by improving dynamic domain rapidly-exploring random tree (DDRRT) to deal with complex obstacles. RRT* is embedded into the planner to optimize paths. The results of Monte Carlo simulation comparing the traditional methods prove that our algorithm behaves well on online path planning with high successful penetration probability.},

The EPF-RRT integrates environmental potential field with the original RRT algorithm, which optimizes the strategy of sampling and expansion. In the EPF-RRT, as the environmental potential field is involved, goal positions generate virtual gravitational force and obstacles are repulsive, the resultant force will guide the RRT grow away from the obstacle and near the target, therefore the efficiency of path planning is greatly improved compared with the RRT. The theoretic analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed EPF-RRT algorithm is characterized by high efficiency, good convergence performance and strong planning ability, which solves the path planning well for UAVs in complicated environments.},
