\maketitle

\ct
Pose to Pose path generation using Dubins Curves in 3-D, plus a verification in simulation.
\cite{ambrosino_algorithms_2006}

\ct
Up to date survey on UAV path planners. Broad and includes algorithms with dynamic areas, replanning, etc. RRT, PRM, Genetic, and Neural Network. Includes specifics on communication protocols.
\cite{ben_amarat_3d_2019}

\ct
Lots of discussion about traveling salesman type problems with dubins vehicles.
\cite{macharet_survey_2018}

\ct
Planning approach under "threats." Threats here are like radars that the airplane wants to avoid. Path is made in 2-D first, then extrapolated into 3-D with a polynomial approximation.
\cite{miller_3d_2011}

\ct
Set of Dubins curves, but in 3-D. Pure-math paper, no figures, no applications.
\cite{sussmann_shortest_1995}

\ct
Shortest path to regions in 2-D with Dubins Curves.

\cite{vana_optimal_2020}


\ct
2014 Survey paper on 3-D path planning for UAVs.

\cite{yang_literature_2014}

\ct
2013 Survey paper on complete coverage algorithms.
\cite{galceran_survey_2013}
