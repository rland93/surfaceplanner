	abstract = {We address optimal path planning in three dimensional space for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the stationary risk environment. We separate the task into two stage, in the ﬁrst one we determine the risk optimal 2D path for ﬁxed time problem. Then we solve the series of BVPs (Boundary Value Problems) with different UAV speeds and determine the admissible 2D path, which satisﬁes the time and risk constraints. In the last step one takes into account the relief along the chosen path and determine the approximated 3D path, which minimizes 2D threat along the path and satisﬁes other constraints.},

	doi = {10.1109/CDC.1995.478997},
	abstract = {We present the solution of the three-dimensional case of a problem regarding the structure of minimum-length paths with a prescribed curvature bound and prescribed initial and terminal positions and directions. In particular, we disprove a conjecture, according to which every minimizer is a concatenation of circles and straight lines. We show that there are many minimizers-the "helicoidal arcs"-that are not of this form. These arcs are smooth and are characterized by the fact that their torsion satisfies a second-order ordinary differential equation. The solution is obtained by applying optimal control theory. An essential feature of the problem is that it requires the use of optimal control on manifolds. The natural state space of the problem is the product of three-dimensional Euclidean space and a two-dimensional sphere. Although the problem is obviously embeddable in 6-dimensional Euclidean space, the maximum principle for the embedded problem yields no information, whereas a careful application of the maximum principle on manifolds yields a very strong result, namely, that every minimizer is either a helicoidal arc or of the form C, S, CS, SC, CSC, CCC, where C, S stand for "circle" and "segment", respectively.},

Among classical instances in the literature, the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Vehicle Routing Problem have been widely studied and frequently considered in the realm of mobile robotics. Understandably, the classical formulation for such problems do not take into account many different issues that arise in real-world scenarios, such as motion constraints and dynamic environments, commonly found in actual robotic systems, and consequently the solutions have been generalized in several ways. In this work, we present a broad and comprehensive review of the classical works and recent breakthroughs regarding the routing techniques ordinarily used in robotic systems and provide references to the most fundamental works in the literature.},

	abstract = {The Generalized Dubins Interval Problem (GDIP) stands to determine the minimal length path connecting two disk-shaped regions where the departure and terminal headings of Dubins vehicle are within the speciﬁed angle intervals. The GDIP is a generalization of the existing point-to-point planning problem for Dubins vehicle with a single heading angle per particular location that can be solved optimally using closed-form expression. For the GDIP, both the heading angles and locations need to be chosen from continuous sets which makes the problem challenging because of inﬁnite possibilities how to connect the regions by Dubins path. We provide the optimal solution of the introduced GDIP based on detailed problem analysis. Moreover, we propose to employ the GDIP to provide the ﬁrst tight lower bound for the Dubins Touring Regions Problem which stands to ﬁnd the shortest curvature-constrained path through a set of regions in the prescribed order.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of 3D path generation and tracking for unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). The proposed path generation algorithm allows us to find a path satisfying arbitrary initial and final conditions, specified in terms of position and velocity. Our method assumes that most of aircraft structural and dynamic limitations can be translated in a turn radius constraint; therefore, the generated paths satisfy a constraint on the minimum admissible turning radius. The proposed algorithm for the path tracking guarantees, under specified assumptions, that the tracking error, both in position and in attitude, asymptotically tends to zero. The work has been carried out with reference to the UAV of the Italian Aerospace Research Center (CIRA). Simulation results for both the path generation and the tracking algorithms are presented; the latter have been obtained using a detailed 6-degree-of-freedom model of the CIRA UAV in the presence of wind and turbulence},

	abstract = {Purpose
              This paper aims to present a comprehensive review in major research areas of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) navigation, i.e. three degree-of-freedom (3D) path planning, routing algorithm and routing protocols. The paper is further aimed to provide a meaningful comparison among these algorithms and methods and also intend to find the best ones for a particular application.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The major UAV navigation research areas are further classified into different categories based on methods and models. Each category is discussed in detail with updated research work done in that very domain. Performance evaluation criteria are defined separately for each category. Based on these criteria and research challenges, research questions are also proposed in this work and answered in discussion according to the presented literature review.
            
            
              Findings
              The research has found that conventional and node-based algorithms are a popular choice for path planning. Similarly, the graph-based methods are preferred for route planning and hybrid routing protocols are proved better in providing performance. The research has also found promising areas for future research directions, i.e. critical link method for UAV path planning and queuing theory as a routing algorithm for large UAV networks.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The proposed work is a first attempt to provide a comprehensive study on all research aspects of UAV navigation. In addition, a comparison of these methods, algorithms and techniques based on standard performance criteria is also presented the very first time.},

Although a lot of works have been done to solve UAV 3D path planning problem, there lacks a comprehensive survey on this topic, let alone the recently published works that focus on this field. This paper analyses the most successful UAV 3D path planning algorithms that developed in recent years. This paper classifies the UAV 3D path planning methods into five categories, sampling-based algorithms, node-based algorithms, mathematical model based algorithms, Bio-inspired algorithms, and multi-fusion based algorithms. For each category a critical analysis and comparison is given. Furthermore a comprehensive applicable analysis for each kind of method is presented after considering its working mechanism and time complexity.},

This task is integral to many robotic applications, such as vacuum cleaning robots, painter robots, autonomous underwater vehicles creating image mosaics, demining robots, lawn mowers, automated harvesters, window cleaners and inspection of complex structures, just to name a few. A considerable body of research has addressed the CPP problem. However, no updated surveys on CPP reflecting recent advances in the field have been presented in the past ten years. In this paper, we present a review of the most successful CPP methods, focusing on the achievements made in the past decade. Furthermore, we discuss reported field applications of the described CPP methods. This work aims to become a starting point for researchers who are initiating their endeavors in CPP. Likewise, this work aims to present a comprehensive review of the recent breakthroughs in the field, providing links to the most interesting and successful works.},
